	  <h2>Mobile Authenticator for Battle.net on WebOS!</h3>
	  <p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>This application is not supported by Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.</li>
	  <li>Battle.net and Blizzard Entertainment are trademarks or registered trademarks of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries.</li>
	  <li>The <a href="http://www.wowpedia.org/Battle.net_Mobile_Authenticator_Specification">Protocol</a> is known of course.</li>
	  <li>This application can manage multiple identities</li>
	  <li>If you have the <b>token</b>, you can add it manually yourself (choose "Custom"); the same way you can backup your tokens generated with this application</li>
	  <li>The "name" and "serial" field are not important - the serial is an identifier used by Battle.net to associate the token with your account, and name is just a field for you</li>
	  <li>The token is entered in hexadecimal format and should be 40 bytes long (20 bytes binary) for Battle.net</li>
	  <li>You can setup auth for your own applications, just have a look at the protocol</li>
	  <li>This application is open source, so you can check the <a href="https://github.com/stbuehler/pre-bnetauth/">source code</a> and build it yourself if you don't trust me :)</li>
	  </ul>
